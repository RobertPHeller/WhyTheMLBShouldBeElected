# WhyTheMLBShouldBeElected
This is a position paper on why I believe the MLB (Municipal Light Board)
should be elected and not appointed.

This repository contains my position paper on Articles 14 and 15 of the
Special Town Meeting on September 26, 2020. Specificly my position that
article 14 should be defeated and article 15 should be approved. Article 14
would create an appointed MLB an article 15 would create an elected MLB. The
paper here will attempt to explain why an elected MLB is the better idea,
especially in the long term.
