# WhyTheMLBShouldBeElected
This is a position paper on why I believe the MLB (Municipal Light Board)
should be elected and not appointed.

This repository contains my position paper on articles 14 and 15.  Specificly 
my position that article 14 should be defeated and article 15 should be 
approved.  Article 14 would create an appointed MLB an article 15 would create 
an elected MLB.  The paper here will attempt to explain why an elected MLB is 
the better idea, especially in the long term.
